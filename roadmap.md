# Cyclone Production Roadmap

- [x] Harden Electron shell security (contextIsolation, sandbox, sanitized file dialogs, richer IPC errors)
- [x] Add build & release pipeline (electron-builder packaging + CI artifacts for CLI and desktop)
- [ ] Create comprehensive automated tests (planner math, plotter rendering, Marlin streaming, CLI smoke tests)
- [ ] Improve runtime UX (file pickers, progress/error toasts, Marlin pause/resume status via IPC)
- [ ] Document and script native dependency rebuilds; pin Node/Electron versions and clean install steps
- [ ] Tighten TypeScript/tooling (strict tsconfig, DOM libs, ESLint/Prettier enforced in CI)
- [ ] Expand documentation (GUI walkthrough, troubleshooting, changelog template, release notes)
